# Linux-Nvidia-ETH-Overlocker
Script to automate overlocking Nvidia cards mining Ethereum on Linux

The script needs optimized as I haven't written linux scripts in a while.
Script will create a file called overclock-cards.sh after identifying your cards and setting up overclock settings
via variables setup on top of the file.

Great for beginners using linux and helps when adding/removing/moving GPU cards.

Added auto-running command to update coolbits and X Config files

Tested on ubuntu OS using GeForce cards on 13 slot ASRock H110 BTC+
Geforce 1050 ~ 12.4 Mh/s  1060 ~ 23.4 Mh/s   1070 ~ 31.1 Mh/s with current settings in script using ethminer
